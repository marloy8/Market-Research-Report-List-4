<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distal Radius Plates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volar Plates</li><li>Dorsal Plates</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Distal radius plates are used in orthopedic surgery to treat fractures of the distal radius, the most common type of forearm fracture. There are two main types of distal radius plates: volar plates and dorsal plates. Volar plates are placed on the palm side of the wrist, while dorsal plates are placed on the back of the wrist. Volar plates are favored for their anatomical fit and good stabilization, while dorsal plates are preferred for their ease of removal. Both types provide stability and support for proper healing of distal radius fractures.</p></p>
