<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Molybdenum Oxide Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotatable Transformation</li><li>Non Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Molybdenum oxide sputtering targets are used in two main types in the market: rotatable transformation and non-rotating type. Rotatable transformation targets are designed to lie flat and rotate during the sputtering process, providing a more uniform coating on the substrate. Non-rotating targets are stationary during sputtering and are generally easier to install and maintain. Both types offer their own advantages and are suitable for different applications based on the specific requirements of the coating process.</p></p>
