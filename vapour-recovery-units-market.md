<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vapour Recovery Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-type Recovery</li><li>Closed-type Recovery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vapour Recovery Units market consists of two main types: open-type recovery and closed-type recovery. Open-type recovery systems are designed to capture vapours released during the storage or transfer of volatile liquids, such as petrol, and redirect them back into the storage tank. On the other hand, closed-type recovery systems are sealed units that allow for the safe capture and treatment of vapours, preventing their release into the atmosphere. Both types of recovery units are essential for reducing emissions and protecting the environment.</p></p>
