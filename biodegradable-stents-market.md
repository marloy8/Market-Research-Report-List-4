<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biodegradable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Based Bioabsorbable Stents</li><li>Metal Based Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biodegradable stents are medical devices that are designed to dissolve and be naturally absorbed by the body over time. There are two main types of biodegradable stents on the market: polymer-based bioabsorbable stents and metal-based bioabsorbable stents. Polymer-based stents are made of materials like polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid, while metal-based stents are typically composed of magnesium or iron. Both types of stents offer the advantage of gradually disappearing once they have served their purpose, reducing the risk of long-term complications associated with traditional permanent stents.</p></p>
