<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lead Oxide Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotatable Transformation</li><li>Non Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lead oxide sputtering targets come in two main market types: rotatable transformation and non-rotating type. Rotatable transformation targets are designed to rotate during sputtering, which helps provide a more uniform deposition on the substrate. They are commonly used in industries where high precision and uniformity are crucial. Non-rotating type targets, on the other hand, do not rotate during sputtering. They are typically used in applications where rotation is not required or desired, such as research labs or specialty coatings.</p></p>
