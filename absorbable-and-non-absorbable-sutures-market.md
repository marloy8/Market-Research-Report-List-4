<p><h1>Global Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market by Types, Applications, and Major Players, with Regional Growth Rate Analysis and Development Situation, from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Absorbable sutures are sutures that are broken down by the body over time, usually within 60-90 days. They are typically made of materials such as synthetic polymers or catgut. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, do not break down and need to be removed by a healthcare provider after the wound has healed. They are often made of materials such as silk, nylon, or polyester.</p><p>The Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.20% during the forecast period. The market growth is driven by factors such as increasing surgical procedures, rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and advancements in surgical techniques. Additionally, the growing geriatric population and increasing demand for minimally invasive surgeries are also contributing to the market growth.</p><p>The latest trends in the Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market include the development of innovative suture materials with enhanced properties such as biocompatibility and antimicrobial effects. Manufacturers are also focusing on producing sutures with improved handling characteristics to make the suturing process easier for healthcare providers. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of absorbable sutures in various surgical applications is expected to drive market growth in the coming years.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Sutures</li><li>Non-Absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absorbable sutures are made from materials that are broken down and absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for removal. They are commonly used in surgeries where the healing process is expected to be quick. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, are made from materials that are not broken down by the body and must be manually removed after a certain period of time. They are ideal for surgeries where long-term wound support is needed. Both types play a crucial role in wound closure and medical procedures.</p></p>
