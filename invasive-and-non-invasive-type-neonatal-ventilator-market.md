<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Invasive and Non-Invasive Type Neonatal Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Invasive neonatal ventilators require the insertion of a tube into the baby's airway, providing mechanical support for breathing. This type of ventilator is typically used in cases of severe respiratory distress. On the other hand, non-invasive neonatal ventilators deliver breathing support through a mask or prongs placed on the baby's face, without the need for intubation. Non-invasive ventilation is often used for less severe respiratory conditions and can be more comfortable for the baby.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Invasive and Non-Invasive Type Neonatal Ventilator Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hospitals</li><li>Clinics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Invasive neonatal ventilators are commonly used in hospitals for newborns who require mechanical assistance to breathe. These machines are connected to the baby's airway through a tube inserted into the trachea. Non-invasive neonatal ventilators, on the other hand, are suitable for use in clinics where newborns may need respiratory support but do not require insertion of a breathing tube. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in providing respiratory support to newborns in different healthcare settings.</p></p>
