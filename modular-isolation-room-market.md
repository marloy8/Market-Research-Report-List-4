<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modular Isolation Room Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Isolation Room</li><li>Negative Pressure Isolation Room</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Modular isolation rooms come in two main types: positive pressure isolation rooms and negative pressure isolation rooms. Positive pressure isolation rooms are designed to maintain a higher air pressure inside the room compared to the surrounding areas, preventing outside contaminants from entering the room. This type of isolation room is commonly used in protecting immunocompromised patients. On the other hand, negative pressure isolation rooms are specifically designed to ensure that air flows from the room into the surrounding areas, preventing the spread of infectious diseases or contaminants outside the room.</p></p>
