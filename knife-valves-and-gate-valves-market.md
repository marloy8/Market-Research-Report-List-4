<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knife Valves and Gate Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Knife Valve</li><li>Gate Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Knife valves are designed with a sharp-edged disc that slices through the flow of liquid, making them well-suited for applications involving thick or viscous fluids. Gate valves, on the other hand, use a sliding gate to control the flow of liquid. Knife valves are often used in applications where a tight shut-off is required, while gate valves are more commonly used for on/off applications in industries such as oil and gas, water treatment, and chemical processing. Both types of valves play a crucial role in regulating fluid flow in various industries.</p></p>
