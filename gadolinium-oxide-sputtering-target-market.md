<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gadolinium Oxide Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotatable Transformation</li><li>Non Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gadolinium oxide sputtering targets come in two main types: rotatable transformation and non-rotating types. Rotatable transformation targets are designed to rotate during the sputtering process, allowing for more uniform deposition of gadolinium oxide. Non-rotating types, on the other hand, remain stationary during sputtering. Each type offers unique advantages depending on the specific needs of the application. Both types are widely used in industries such as electronics, optics, and energy for thin film deposition processes.</p></p>
