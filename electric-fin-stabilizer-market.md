<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Fin Stabilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retractable</li><li>Non-Retractable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric fin stabilizers are used in ships to reduce rolling and improve stability. They are available in two main types - retractable and non-retractable. Retractable stabilizers can be folded into the hull when not in use, reducing drag and increasing efficiency. Non-retractable stabilizers remain fixed in place at all times. Both types offer improved comfort for passengers and crew by reducing the effects of rough seas, but retractable stabilizers are often preferred for their versatility and impact on fuel consumption.</p></p>
