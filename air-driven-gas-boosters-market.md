<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Driven Gas Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air driven gas boosters come in two main types: Single Acting and Double Acting. Single Acting boosters use air pressure to compress gas in one direction, while Double Acting boosters compress gas in both directions. Single Acting boosters are simpler in design and more cost-effective, making them suitable for applications requiring lower pressures. Double Acting boosters provide more power and efficiency by compressing gas on both the forward and backward strokes, making them ideal for high-pressure and high-flow applications.</p></p>
