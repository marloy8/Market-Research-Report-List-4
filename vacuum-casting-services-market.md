<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Casting Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Casting</li><li>Non-centrifugal Casting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum casting services involve two main market types: centrifugal casting and non-centrifugal casting. Centrifugal casting uses centrifugal force to distribute molten material into a mold, resulting in a more even distribution and fewer defects. Non-centrifugal casting, on the other hand, relies on vacuum pressure to draw the material into the mold, providing more control over the casting process. Both methods have their advantages and are used in various industries for producing high-quality and precise components.</p></p>
