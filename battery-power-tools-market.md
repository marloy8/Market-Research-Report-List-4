<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Battery Power Tools Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brushed Motor</li><li>Brushless Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Battery power tools are classified into two main types based on their motor technology: brushed motor and brushless motor. Brushed motors have carbon brushes that contact the armature to create the magnetic field, resulting in friction and wear over time. On the other hand, brushless motors use electronic controls to create the magnetic field, eliminating the need for brushes and reducing maintenance. Brushless motor tools are often more efficient, durable, and have longer lifespan compared to brushed motor tools, making them a popular choice among consumers.</p></p>
