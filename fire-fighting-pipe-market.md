<p><strong>The Fire Fighting Pipe Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Fire Sprinkler System</li><li>Dry Fire Sprinkler System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire fighting pipe market includes applications for both wet and dry fire sprinkler systems. Wet fire sprinkler systems are filled with water and are ready to disperse immediately upon activation, making them ideal for areas where fires can spread quickly. Dry fire sprinkler systems are filled with pressurized air or nitrogen, with water held back by a valve until the system is activated. This makes them suitable for areas where freezing temperatures could cause water in the pipes to freeze.</p></p>
