<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydro Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impulse Turbine</li><li>Reaction Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydro generators come in two main types: Impulse Turbine and Reaction Turbine. Impulse turbines are best suited for high head, low flow applications, where the water hits the turbine blades with high speed and pressure. Reaction turbines, on the other hand, work well in low head, high flow situations, as they rely on the reaction force of water flowing over the blades to generate power. Both types of turbines play a crucial role in harnessing hydroelectric power efficiently and sustainably.</p></p>
