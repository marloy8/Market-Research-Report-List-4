<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Power Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Boiler</li><li>Steam Turbine</li><li>Generator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal power equipment market consists of three main types - boiler, steam turbine, and generator. Boilers are used to generate steam by heating water which is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity. Steam turbines convert the energy from steam into rotational motion, which drives the generator to produce electrical power. Generators then convert this mechanical energy into electrical energy. These three components work together in thermal power plants to generate electricity efficiently from heat energy.</p></p>
