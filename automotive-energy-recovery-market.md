<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Energy Recovery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regenerative Braking System</li><li>Turbocharger</li><li>Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Energy Recovery Market consists of three main types: Regenerative Braking System, Turbocharger, and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems. Regenerative Braking System captures and stores energy usually lost during braking and converts it into usable electrical energy. Turbocharger uses exhaust gases to spin a turbine, increasing the efficiency of the engine by compressing intake air. EGR reduces emissions by recirculating a portion of exhaust gases back into the engine to lower combustion temperature and reduce harmful pollutants.</p></p>
