<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Acting Gas Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Double Stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single stage gas boosters have a single pumping stage, meaning the gas is compressed one time before being discharged. This type of booster is simpler and more cost-effective, making it suitable for lower pressure applications. Double stage gas boosters, on the other hand, have two pumping stages, allowing for a higher level of compression. This type of booster is ideal for high pressure applications where a single stage booster may not provide enough compression.</p></p>
