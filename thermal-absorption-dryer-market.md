<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Absorption Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intermittent</li><li>Continuous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal absorption dryers can be categorized into two main types based on their operation: intermittent and continuous. Intermittent dryers operate in cycles, where the drying process is periodically stopped and started again. On the other hand, continuous dryers run continuously without any interruptions. Intermittent dryers are typically used for small-scale applications or where space is limited, while continuous dryers are more commonly used for larger-scale operations that require a constant and consistent drying process.</p></p>
