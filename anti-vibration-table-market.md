<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-vibration Table Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Anti-vibration Table</li><li>Active Anti-vibration Table</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive anti-vibration tables are designed to reduce vibrations by isolating the table from external disturbances, such as floor vibrations. They typically use materials like rubber or air springs to absorb and dampen vibrations. Active anti-vibration tables, on the other hand, actively counteract vibrations by using sensors and actuators to detect and cancel out any unwanted movement. They are more sophisticated and precise in their vibration control capabilities, making them ideal for highly-sensitive equipment and research applications.</p></p>
