<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Equilibrium Dialysis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Regression</li><li>Non-Linear Regression</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the equilibrium dialysis market, different types of regression techniques are used for analyzing data. Linear regression is a type of regression where the relationship between variables is assumed to be linear, while non-linear regression considers non-linear relationships between variables. Linear regression is often used when the relationship between variables is straightforward, while non-linear regression is used when the relationship is more complex and cannot be adequately represented by a straight line. Both methods have their own advantages and are chosen based on the nature of the data being analyzed.</p></p>
