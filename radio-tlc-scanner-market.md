<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radio-TLC Scanner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Collimator</li><li>Single Collimator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Radio-TLC scanner market consists of two main types: Dual Collimator and Single Collimator. Dual Collimator scanners use two collimators to simultaneously detect and measure radioactivity from two different samples, increasing efficiency and throughput. Single Collimator scanners, on the other hand, use only one collimator to scan one sample at a time. Both types have their own advantages and limitations, with Dual Collimator scanners being preferable for high-throughput applications and Single Collimator scanners being more suitable for smaller-scale or research settings.</p></p>
